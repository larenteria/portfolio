# portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! 

A few quick details: 
1. NNN Projects and dataScraper are mostly done, but I plan to keep working on dataScraper a bit more after I finish Chess.
2. Currently, I am working on finishing Chess, and then creating a funcitonal engine in order to play against.

When all is finished I will update this read me file, including introducing new projects! 
I would recommend checking out Chess and playing against yourself first! 

My best,
Luis
