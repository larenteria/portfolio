WAIT!!! If you're here, instead of checking this out, go to the new website: https://larenteria.github.io/portfolio-website/

QUICK UPDATES: 
- Chess logic now fully implemented. Works as a simple two player game

Hello and welcome... 
to my portfolio! 

A few quick details: 
1. If you came from the website, the project 'GALAXY' is zipped on the research paper linked on the page, not here. 
2. NNN Projects and dataScraper are mostly done, but I plan to keep working on dataScraper a bit more after I finish Chess.
3. Chess is finished, but I need to implement a UI for customization and build the engine (which is first priority).

When all is finished I will update this read me file, including introducing new projects! 
I would recommend checking out Chess and playing against yourself first! 

My best,

Luis
